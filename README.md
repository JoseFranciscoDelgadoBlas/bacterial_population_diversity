## bacterial_population_genomic_diversity
R code to analyze differential bacterial populations from genomic data in order to assess diversity of total gene content, plasmid content and antimicrobial resistance gene content.

The R code files here indicated are broadly explained and linked to the work “Population genomics and evolutionary history of Escherichia coli resistant to last-resort antibiotics in wastewater and river environments” by Delgado-Blas et al.
