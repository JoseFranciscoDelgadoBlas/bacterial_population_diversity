# bacterial_population_genomic_diversity
R codes to analyze differential bacterial populations from different ecological niches based on genomic data in order to assess diversity of total gene content, plasmid content and antimicrobial resistance gene content.

The R code files here indicated are broadly explained and linked to the work “Population genomics and evolutionary history of Escherichia coli resistant to last-resort antibiotics in wastewater and river environments” by Delgado-Blas et al.
